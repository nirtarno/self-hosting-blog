Welcome to my new blog! This is my first post, and I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences with you.


Hi, I’m Nir — a software engineer who enjoys building systems, breaking them, and figuring out how they really work.

I’m especially interested in distributed systems, cloud infrastructure, and MLOps, but what really drives me is doing things **practically and cheaply**. I like finding ways to run useful software on minimal hardware, self-host services, and build tools that don’t require a big budget or enterprise setup.

## What I Write About

- Cheap and practical self-hosting  
- Homelab experiments  
- Backend and system design ideas  
- Event-driven architectures and infrastructure  
- Things I’m learning while building real systems  

Most of what I write comes from hands-on experiments, not theory. I prefer simple solutions, clear trade-offs, and tools that solve real problems without unnecessary complexity.

If you like the idea of doing serious software work with limited resources, you’ll probably feel at home here.
